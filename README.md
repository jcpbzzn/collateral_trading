## Introduction

Repo is essentially a secured loand and the name stands for *sale and repurchase agreement*. 
In a classic repo one party will enter into a contract to sell securities, simultaneously agreeing to purchasing them back at a specified future date and price. The securities can be bonds or equities but also money market instruments such as T-Bills. The buyer of the securities is handing over cash, which on the termination of the trade will be returned to them, and on which they will receive interest.
The seller in a classic repo is selling or *offering* stock, and therefore receiving cash, whereas the buyer is buying or bidding for stock, and consequently paying cash. So if the one week repo interest rate is quoted by a market-making desk at as "5½ - 5¼", this means that the market-maker will bid for stock, that is, lend the cash, at 5.50% and offers stock or pays interest on borrowed cash at 5.25%. In some markets the quote is reversed.
